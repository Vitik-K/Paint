				<h2>Paint Composition</h2>
				<p>
					Paints usually contain three key components: pigments, binders and additives. Pigments are dry, 
					insoluble powders that by wave length-selective absorption (ie they only reflect certain wavelengths) 
					change the colour of reflected or transmitted light, giving paint its colorization. They can be ascertained 
					either naturally or produced synthetically.

				<h2>Mechanism of Paint Drying</h2>
				<p> 
					The majority of paints dry through evaporation, a process that allows its pigmentation to be 
					set onto a chosen surface purely by being exposed to the surrounding atmosphere. However, the 
					drying process can vary and is often complicated and altered between different paint types.

				<h2>2012 Watching Paint Dry Championship</h2>
				<p>
					In 2012, the watching paint dry championship was held in entral England. The top 64 entrants 
					from around the world participated in a preliminary round where they stared at a wall freshly 
					painted with their favorite color. Winners from this round advanced to the semi-final and final
					rounds where they had to stare at a wall freshly painted with the color they most disliked. The 
					winner walked away with prize of $100,000 and a new coat of paint for their home.

				<h2 id="info_jump">An expression origin story.</h2>
				<p>
					"Watching paint dry", closely related to "watching the grass grow", is an English-language 
					idiom that means something is incredibly boring or tedious. 
					It is thought to have originated in the United States. A well known (maybe?) example of this phrase being used
					in media is from 1969, where sports announcer Red Baber stated that watching baseball was " as exciting as watching
					paint dry". 
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2016, British film maker Charlie Lyne created a 10 hour long film titled 'Paint Drying'. This amazing cinamatic  
					masterpiece was all about, you guessed it, paint drying and was made specifically to protest against the British Board of Film 
					Classification and their high fees and censorship.
